What is a Virtual Machine(VM)? 

A virtual machine is no different than any other physical computer like a laptop, smart phone, or server. It has a CPU, memory, disks to store your files, and can connect to the internet if needed. While the parts that make up your computer (called hardware) are physical and tangible, VMs are often thought of as virtual computers or software-defined computers within physical servers, existing only as code.

What is Hypervisor?

A hypervisor is a virtualization software that enables multiple virtual machines (VMs)—each with its own operating system (OS)—to run on one physical server. The hypervisor pools and allocates physical computing resources as needed by the VM, enabling efficiency, flexibility and scalability.It separates VMs from each other logically, assigning each its own slice of the underlying computing power, memory and storage. This prevents the VMs from interfering with each other. For example, if one OS suffers a crash or a security compromise, the others survive.

What is a server?

A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. The term server can refer to a physical machine, a virtual machine (VM) or software that's performing server services.In the client-server model, a server program fulfills requests from client programs, which might be running on the same computer or other computers.


A virtual server is a virtual representation of a physical server. Like a physical server, a virtual server includes its own OS and applications
